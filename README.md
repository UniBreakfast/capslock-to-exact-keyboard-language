## What is it

It's a custom AutoHotkey script made by me [UniBreakfast](https://github.com/UniBreakfast) and [BuYn](https://github.com/Buyn).

And it is compiled into a Windows executable to simply run without the need to install AutoHotkey on your PC.

## What does it do

It disables the standard behavior of the `CapsLock` key, so it does not turn ON/OFF any more. And it has nothing to do with upper or lower case now too.

Instead it switches the keyboard language. It's made for those who are like me grew tired of constantly guessing which language is it now and how many times do they have to press `Ctrl + Shift` or `Alt + Shift` for it to be the keyboard language they need right now.

##### currently supported languages:

|              keys | language  |
|------------------:|:---------:|
|        `CapsLock` |  English  |
|  `Alt + CapsLock` |  Russian  |
| `Ctrl + CapsLock` | Ukrainian |

## How to install
Simply download the `CapsLock to exact keyboard language.exe` to your computer and add the shortcut for it into your user Startup folder. For me it was

```c:\Users\Michael\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\```

(on Windows 11). You can easily find your Startup folder if you Google for it.
